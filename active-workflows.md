## Adding New Workflows

Workflows are added to this tracker when:
- **POV:** Day 1 Workshop complete, opportunities prioritized
- **POC:** SOW approved, 30-day engagement initiated
- **Pilot:** POC successful, pilot deployment approved
- **Program:** Pilot validated, full-scale deployment and transfer complete
- **Partnership:** Strategic relationship established with ongoing pipeline
