# Capability Transfer Playbook

How we transfer workflow ownership to clients, ensuring sustainability and independence. Our work is complete when clients can operate, troubleshoot, and improve workflows on their own.

---

## Capability Transfer Philosophy

**Client independence is the outcome**  
We measure success by client ability to sustain and evolve workflows without IA dependency.

**Transfer happens progressively**  
Knowledge and ownership transfer begins in POC and continues through Program launch.

**Documentation enables sustainability**  
Complete, clear documentation ensures workflows can be maintained and improved over time.

**Training builds confidence**  
Hands-on training with real scenarios prepares teams to operate workflows effectively.

- Record training videos for reference

### Challenge: Team Turnover
**Mitigation:**
- Document everything, assume no institutional knowledge
- Create onboarding procedures for new team members
- Maintain "knowledge champions" across client organization
- Offer refresher training periodically

### Challenge: Confidence in Independence
**Mitigation:**
- Gradual support reduction with clear milestones
- "Office hours" for questions during transition
- Celebrate early wins and client-led improvements
