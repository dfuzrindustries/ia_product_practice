# Case Studies & Proof Points

Success stories and verified results from completed workflows. Each case study demonstrates sustainable economic impact and validates our approach.

## Active Case Studies

*Case studies are added when workflows reach Program phase with verified, sustained impact.*

### [Workflow Name] — [Client/Vertical]

**Phase:** Program  
**Launch Date:** [Date]  
**Status:** Active, Client-Operated

#### Challenge

[Brief description of the business problem or opportunity. What was the client struggling with? What outcome were they pursuing?]

#### Solution

[Description of the workflow designed and deployed. What human-agent collaboration model was used? What governance was built in?]

#### Approach

**POV:** [Date] — [Key findings from Day 1 Workshop]  
**POC:** [Date - Date] — [Technical validation and prototype results]  
**Pilot:** [Date - Date] — [Production testing with real users]  
**Program:** [Date] — [Full deployment and capability transfer]

#### Results

**Economic Impact:**
- **Dollars Saved:** $[amount] annually
- **Dollars Earned:** $[amount] annually
- **Total Impact:** $[amount] annually

**Operational Metrics:**
- Time savings: [X hours/week or X% reduction]
- Quality improvement: [X% error reduction or accuracy increase]
- User adoption: [X% of target users actively using]
- Reliability: [X% uptime]

**Client Self-Sufficiency:**
- Client team operates workflow independently
- [X] team members trained and certified
- Zero IA dependency for day-to-day operations

#### Key Success Factors

- [Factor 1: e.g., Strong executive sponsorship]
- [Factor 2: e.g., Clean, accessible data]
- [Factor 3: e.g., User-centered design approach]

## Coming Soon

The following workflows are in Pilot phase and will be documented as case studies once economic impact is verified and sustained:

| Workflow | Client/Vertical | Current Phase | Expected Completion |
|----------|-----------------|---------------|---------------------|
| [Example] | [TBD] | Pilot | [TBD] |

### Common Patterns

As we build our case study library, we'll identify and document patterns that lead to successful outcomes:

**High-Impact Workflows Share:**
- Clear ownership and executive sponsorship
- Strong data availability and quality
- Measurable, frequent processes
- User buy-in from pilot phase
- Embedded governance and measurement

**Successful Deployments Feature:**
- Evidence-based progression through phases
- Early user involvement in design
- Comprehensive capability transfer
- Continuous improvement mindset

## Using Case Studies

**For Executive Leadership:**  
Use these stories to communicate value to boards, investors, and stakeholders. Each case study demonstrates validated ROI and sustainable impact.

**For Product Working Group:**  
Reference these patterns when scoping new opportunities. Learn from what worked and apply those lessons to new engagements.

**For Product Practice Team:**  
Study these implementations to understand what drives success. Use proven patterns as templates for new workflow designs.

## Submitting a Case Study

Workflows become case studies when they meet these criteria:
- Program phase active for 6+ months
- Economic impact verified and sustained
- Client operating workflow independently
- All deliverables complete (documentation, training, handoff)
- Client approval for external sharing

Contact the Product Practice team to initiate case study development.
