## Impact Verification

All economic impact reported here is verified through:
- Baseline measurement before workflow deployment
- Real-time tracking during pilot and program phases
- Client validation of results
- Documentation of methodology and assumptions

**Impact Categories:**
- **Verified:** Impact measured and validated with client
- **Projected:** Impact modeled based on hypothesis and pilot data
- **Sustained:** Impact maintained over 6+ months post-deployment

---

## How We Measure

Economic impact is calculated using:

**Cost Savings:**
- Time savings × fully-loaded labor cost
- Error reduction × cost per error
- Process acceleration × opportunity cost

**Revenue Generation:**
- New revenue enabled by workflow
- Revenue retention through improved service
- Expansion revenue from capability enhancement

**Risk Reduction:**
- Compliance incidents avoided × average cost
- Security improvements × expected loss reduction

All calculations use conservative assumptions and client-validated data.
