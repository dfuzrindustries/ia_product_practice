# How We Work — Phase-Gated Delivery

Intelligent Agency's Product Practice delivers AI-enabled workflows through a disciplined, evidence-based approach. Each phase proves value and builds confidence before advancing to the next.

---

## The Phase-Gated Model

```
POV → POC → Pilot → Program → Partnership
```

Each gate requires documented evidence, stakeholder alignment, and clear success criteria before proceeding.

---

## Phase 1: Point of View (POV)

**Purpose:** Outcome of Day 1 diagnostic workshop identifying prioritized workflow opportunities

The POV is a deliverable from a 6-hour facilitated Day 1 Workshop that diagnoses current state and identifies 1-3 high-value workflow redesign opportunities.

**Success Measures:**
- Clear economic impact hypothesis with measurable targets
- Stakeholder alignment on problem definition and value
- Documented baseline metrics and readiness assessment
- Approved investment for POC phase

**Typical Duration:** 1 day workshop + 48-72 hours for deliverable production

---

## Phase 2: Proof of Concept (POC)

**Purpose:** Demonstrate technical feasibility and workflow design

**Success Measures:**
- Working prototype demonstrating core workflow
- Technical feasibility confirmed
- Human-agent roles clearly defined
- Governance framework designed
- Approved plan for pilot phase

**Typical Duration:** 30 days ($75,000 investment)

---

## Phase 3: Pilot

**Purpose:** Prove the workflow in production with real users

**Success Measures:**
- Verified economic impact ($ saved or earned)
- Demonstrated reliability and user adoption
- Governance operating effectively
- Pilot users capable of operating workflow
- Business case validated for program scale
- Capability transfer plan approved

**Typical Duration:** 8-12 weeks

---

## Phase 4: Program

**Purpose:** Transfer capability and scale with client ownership

**Success Measures:**
- Client operates workflow independently
- Economic impact sustained over time
- Workflow scaled beyond pilot scope
- Client demonstrates self-sufficiency in troubleshooting and improvement

**Ongoing:** Continuous measurement and improvement

---

## Phase 5: Partnership

**Purpose:** Establish ongoing collaboration for sustained transformation

**Success Measures:**
- Long-term strategic alignment achieved
- Continuous innovation pipeline established
- Client capability development ongoing
- Expanding value creation across additional workflows

## Principles Applied Across All Phases

**Evidence-based progression**  
Each phase generates documented evidence that informs the next phase and validates continued investment.

**Embedded measurement**  
KPIs, financial tracking, and performance metrics are built into the workflow from POV through Program.

**Governance by design**  
Controls, approvals, and compliance requirements are designed in from the beginning, not retrofitted.

**Capability transfer from day one**  
Every phase includes documentation and knowledge transfer activities, building toward full client ownership.

**Systems thinking**  
Workflow design considers organizational context, technical dependencies, and operational constraints throughout.

## Why Phase-Gated Delivery Works

**Reduces risk:** Small investments prove value before large commitments

**Builds confidence:** Evidence from each phase informs the next

**Enables learning:** Real-world feedback shapes design and scale decisions

**Ensures sustainability:** Capability transfer is planned and executed progressively

**Delivers impact:** Economic value is measured and verified before scaling
