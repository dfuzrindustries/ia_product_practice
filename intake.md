# Intake Process

How new opportunities enter the Product Practice pipeline. This process ensures we pursue the right workflows with the right clients at the right time.

## Intake Philosophy

**Quality over quantity**  
We pursue opportunities with high potential for economic impact and strategic value.

**Early qualification**  
We assess fit before investing significant time or resources.

**Transparent pipeline**  
Everyone can see what's in flight and what's on deck.

**Clear decision criteria**  
Objective frameworks guide Go/No-Go decisions.
