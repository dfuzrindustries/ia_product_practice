# Intelligent Agency — Product Practice Manifesto

## Purpose
Design, prove, and scale AI-enabled processes that deliver measurable economic impact.

---

## Philosophy
Our process is our product. AI and technology accelerate outcomes through repeatable, governed workflows that clients can operate independently.

---

## North Star
Number of workflows automated with verified dollars saved or earned.

---

## How We Work

We deliver through a phase-gated model that proves value before scaling:

### POV (Point of View)
Outcome of the Day 1 diagnostic workshop identifying 1-3 high-value workflow opportunities with clear business impact and readiness assessment.

### POC (Proof of Concept)
Demonstrate technical feasibility and agent-human collaboration design in a 30-day engagement.

### Pilot
Prove the workflow in production with real users, embedded measurement, and governance.

### Program
Transfer capability to clients and scale workflows with sustained client ownership.

### Partnership
Establish ongoing collaboration for sustained transformation and continuous innovation.

## Core Practices

**Workflow-centric development**  
We build end-to-end processes with clear owners, embedded metrics, and economic value.

**Phase-gated delivery**  
Each phase requires documented evidence before proceeding to the next.

**Embedded measurement**  
KPIs and financial impact tracking are built into every workflow from the beginning.

**Capability transfer**  
Clients receive complete documentation, training, and operational ownership.

---

## What Success Looks Like

Sustained client-owned workflows delivering ongoing financial impact.

Clients operate, evolve, and scale workflows independently.

Economic value compounds over time through continuous improvement.

---

## Our Commitment

We build for:
- **Economic impact** — Dollars saved and earned
- **Client independence** — Capability transfer and self-sufficiency
- **Evidence-based scale** — Proven value before expansion
- **Human-agent collaboration** — Explicit roles, governance, and accountability
