# How We Measure Impact

Methodology for calculating and verifying economic impact. This framework ensures consistent, conservative, and client-validated measurement across all workflows.

---

## Measurement Principles

1. **Baseline first** — Establish current-state metrics before any intervention
2. **Conservative assumptions** — Use lower-bound estimates when ranges exist
3. **Client validation** — All impact claims are verified with client stakeholders
4. **Sustained measurement** — Track impact over time to ensure sustainability
5. **Transparent methodology** — Document all assumptions and calculation methods

## Economic Impact Categories

### Cost Savings

Money saved through efficiency, automation, or error reduction.

**Calculation Methods:**

**Time Savings**
```
Annual Savings = (Hours Saved per Week × Weeks per Year × Number of Users × Fully-Loaded Labor Cost)
```

*Example:* Workflow saves 5 hours/week for 20 users at $75/hr fully-loaded cost
- 5 hrs/week × 50 weeks × 20 users × $75/hr = **$375,000 annually**

**Error Reduction**
```
Annual Savings = (Errors Avoided per Year × Cost per Error)
```

*Example:* Workflow prevents 100 errors/year at $2,000 average cost per error
- 100 errors × $2,000 = **$200,000 annually**

**Process Acceleration**
```
Annual Savings = (Cycle Time Reduction × Frequency × Opportunity Cost)
```

*Example:* Workflow reduces approval cycle from 5 days to 1 day, 200 times/year at $500/day opportunity cost
- 4 days × 200 cycles × $500/day = **$400,000 annually**

---

### Revenue Generation

Money earned through new capabilities, faster time-to-market, or improved customer outcomes.

**Calculation Methods:**

**New Revenue Enabled**
```
Annual Impact = (New Deals Enabled × Average Deal Size) OR (New Customers × Customer Lifetime Value)
```

*Example:* Workflow enables 10 additional deals/year at $50,000 average
- 10 deals × $50,000 = **$500,000 annually**

**Revenue Retention**
```
Annual Impact = (Churn Reduction % × At-Risk Revenue)
```

*Example:* Workflow reduces churn by 5% on $10M at-risk revenue
- 5% × $10,000,000 = **$500,000 annually**

**Expansion Revenue**
```
Annual Impact = (Upsell Rate Increase × Eligible Customer Base × Average Upsell Value)
```

*Example:* Workflow increases upsell conversion from 10% to 15% on 1,000 customers at $5,000 average upsell
- 5% increase × 1,000 customers × $5,000 = **$250,000 annually**

---

### Risk Reduction

Financial impact of avoided compliance violations, security incidents, or legal exposure.

**Calculation Methods:**

**Compliance Incidents Avoided**
```
Annual Impact = (Incidents Avoided × Average Cost per Incident)
```

*Example:* Workflow prevents 5 compliance violations/year at $100,000 average cost
- 5 incidents × $100,000 = **$500,000 annually**

**Security Improvements**
```
Annual Impact = (Expected Loss Reduction from Security Enhancement)
```

*Example:* Workflow reduces expected annual loss from data breaches by $200,000
- **$200,000 annually**

## Baseline Measurement Process

### Before Workflow Deployment

**Step 1: Define Metrics**
- Identify key performance indicators affected by workflow
- Document current-state measurement methods
- Establish data sources and tracking mechanisms

**Step 2: Collect Baseline Data**
- Measure current state for minimum 2 weeks (preferably 4 weeks)
- Calculate averages and identify variability
- Document assumptions and exclusions

**Step 3: Build Impact Model**
- Project expected improvements from workflow
- Calculate potential economic impact using conservative assumptions
- Document methodology and validate with stakeholders

**Step 4: Set Success Thresholds**
- Define minimum acceptable improvement
- Set Go/No-Go criteria for phase gates
- Establish ongoing measurement plan

## Ongoing Measurement During Deployment

### Pilot Phase

**Weekly Tracking:**
- Measure actual performance vs. baseline
- Track user adoption and engagement
- Document issues and improvement opportunities

**Monthly Validation:**
- Calculate realized impact to date
- Compare to hypothesis and adjust projections
- Review with client stakeholders

---

### Program Phase

**Monthly Reporting:**
- Sustained impact over time
- User adoption and satisfaction
- Operational metrics (uptime, errors, support tickets)

**Quarterly Business Review:**
- Cumulative impact achieved
- Comparison to baseline and projections
- Client validation of results
- Opportunities for expansion or optimization

---

## Impact Verification

All economic impact must be verified through:

**1. Data Validation**
- Source data reviewed and confirmed accurate
- Calculations independently verified
- Assumptions documented and reasonable

**2. Client Confirmation**
- Client stakeholders review and approve impact claims
- Client signs off on methodology and results
- Client provides quote or testimonial (when appropriate)

**3. Sustainability Check**
- Impact tracked for minimum 6 months
- Performance remains consistent over time
- Client demonstrates operational ownership

**4. Documentation**
- Complete impact report with methodology
- Baseline and ongoing measurement data
- Client validation and approval

---

## Conservative Assumptions Guidelines

When calculating impact, always use conservative assumptions:

**Time Savings:**
- Use median, not average, hourly rates
- Exclude overtime or premium labor costs unless standard
- Assume 80% realization of theoretical time savings (for adoption/learning curve)

**Error Reduction:**
- Use documented average cost per error, not worst-case
- Only count errors directly prevented by workflow
- Exclude indirect or secondary effects

**Revenue Impact:**
- Attribute only incremental revenue directly enabled by workflow
- Use trailing 12-month averages for deal size/customer value
- Discount projections for first-year ramp-up period

**Risk Reduction:**
- Use industry-standard cost estimates for incidents
- Only count incidents with documented likelihood
- Apply probability weighting to potential events

## Reporting Impact

### Impact Classification

**Verified Impact:**
- Measured in production for 6+ months
- Client-validated methodology and results
- Sustained performance demonstrated

**Projected Impact:**
- Based on pilot data and validated assumptions
- Not yet sustained over 6+ months
- Conservative estimate with clear methodology

**Hypothesis Impact:**
- POV or POC phase estimates
- Based on baseline analysis and similar workflows
- Clearly labeled as unverified projection
