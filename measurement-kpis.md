## Why This Matters

**For Executive Leadership:**  
These metrics provide visibility into product practice performance and economic impact. Use this section to understand what we measure, why it matters, and how to interpret results.

**For Product Working Group:**  
This is your shared accountability framework. These metrics guide prioritization, inform resource allocation, and enable data-driven decisions.

**For Product Practice Team:**  
These are your success criteria. Every workflow, every phase gate, every deliverable is measured against these frameworks.

## Our Measurement Philosophy

**Measurement is embedded, not added**  
We build tracking into workflows from the beginning. KPIs and instrumentation are part of the design, not separate reporting exercises.

**Economic impact defines success**  
We measure outcomes, not outputs. Success means verified dollars saved or earned, not features shipped or users onboarded.

**Evidence enables scale**  
Measurement creates the evidence we need to prove value, secure investment, and scale with confidence.
