## Our Enablement Philosophy

**Make it easy to do the right thing**  
Resources should reduce friction, not create it.

**Build on what works**  
Templates and tools emerge from validated patterns, not theory.

**Keep it current**  
Resources are living documents that evolve with our practice.

**Share knowledge generously**  
What we learn benefits everyone in the practice.
