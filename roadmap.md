# Intelligent OS — Workflow-Centric Roadmap

This roadmap defines how Intelligent OS evolves through workflows that deliver verified economic impact.

**North Star:** Number of workflows automated with verified dollars saved or earned.

---

## How to Read This Roadmap

Each roadmap row represents:
- A named workflow (unit of value)
- Its current phase: POV / POC / Pilot / Program
- The Intelligent OS layers it strengthens
- The economic impact hypothesis
- The KPIs used to verify impact

---

## Near Term (0–90 Days) — Prove & Package

| Workflow | Phase | OS Layers | Process Outcome | Economic Impact | KPIs |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Product Discovery Intake → Prioritization | POV | Workflow, Intelligence | Faster, repeatable opportunity selection | ↓ discovery time, ↑ win quality | Time-to-POV, Win Rate |
| KPI Definition & Exec Reporting | POC | Intelligence, Orchestration | Standardized reporting cadence | ↓ manual reporting hours | Reporting hours saved |
| Workflow ROI Tracking | POC | Intelligence | Verified impact per workflow | Verified $ saved / earned | ROI per workflow |

---

## Mid Term (3–6 Months) — Validate in Production

| Workflow | Phase | OS Layers | Process Outcome | Economic Impact | KPIs |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Product Backlog → Delivery Planning | Pilot | Workflow, Orchestration | Predictable delivery decisions | ↓ rework, ↑ throughput | Cycle time, On-time delivery |
| Revenue Forecasting | Pilot | Agent, Intelligence | Improved forecast accuracy | ↑ revenue predictability | Forecast variance |
| Customer Health Scoring | Pilot | Agent, Intelligence | Proactive retention actions | ↓ churn | Retention, NRR |

---

## Long Term (6–12 Months) — Scale & Systematize

| Workflow | Phase | OS Layers | Process Outcome | Economic Impact | KPIs |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Cross-Functional Planning | Program | CEO Synthesis | Aligned operating cadence | Faster decisions | Decision latency |
| Resource Allocation Optimization | Program | Agent, Intelligence | Capital to highest ROI | ↑ ROI | ROI delta, Margin |
| Continuous Improvement Loop | Program | All Layers | Self-optimizing workflows | Sustained gains | $ per workflow |

# Product Roadmap

This roadmap represents the prioritized set of workflows Intelligent Agency is designing, proving, and scaling through IntelligentOS. Workflows are the unit of value. Economic impact is the measure of success.

**North Star:** Number of workflows automated with verified dollars saved or earned

## IntelligentOS Architecture Reference

- **Workflow Layer:** End-to-end processes with owners and metrics
- **Agent Layer:** Functional AI agents executing and advising
- **Orchestration Layer:** Human–agent coordination and governance
- **Intelligence Layer:** KPIs, insights, and learning loops
- **CEO Synthesis Layer:** Cross-functional visibility and decisions

---

## Workflow Graduation Rubric

### POV → POC
- Clear workflow definition
- Named owner
- Baseline established
- Economic hypothesis defined

### POC → Pilot
- Working prototype validated
- Real user adoption
- Measurable impact demonstrated
- Governance risks understood

### Pilot → Program
- ROI validated in production
- Adoption stable
- Process documented (SOPs)
- Client ownership established

Workflows that do not meet graduation criteria are paused, redesigned, or retired.

---

## Integration with Success Model KPIs

### Financial
- Revenue Growth Rate
- Gross Margin
- ROI per workflow

### Operational
- Automation hours saved
- On-time delivery
- Cycle time reduction

### Customer
- Retention rate
- Net Revenue Retention
- NPS (workflow cohorts)

### Brand & Culture (Internal)
- Adoption rate
- Internal productivity lift

Each workflow supports at least one Success Model KPI.

---

## Governance

- Each workflow has a Product Owner
- Each workflow reports impact monthly
- Scores are recalculated quarterly
- Roadmap reviewed in Product + CEO cadence

---

## Guiding Principle

Workflows graduate only when they produce verified economic impact and can be operated independently.
