# Product Roadmap

This roadmap represents the prioritized set of workflows Intelligent Agency is designing, proving, and scaling through IntelligentOS. Workflows are the unit of value. Economic impact is the measure of success.

**North Star:** Number of workflows automated with verified dollars saved or earned

## Near Term (0–90 Days) — Prove & Package

| Workflow | Use Case | Phase | Process Outcome | IntelligentOS Layer | Economic Impact | KPIs | Maturity Lift |
|---------|----------|-------|-----------------|----------------------|-----------------|------|---------------|
| Product Discovery Intake → Prioritization | IA + Clients | POV | Faster, repeatable opportunity selection | Workflow + Intelligence | ↓ Discovery time, ↑ win quality | Time-to-POV, Win Rate | L1 → L2 |
| KPI Definition & Exec Reporting | IA Internal | POC | Standardized, automated reporting | Intelligence + Orchestration | ↓ Manual reporting hours | Hours saved, Exec cadence | L2 |
| Workflow ROI Tracking | IA + Clients | POC | Measured impact per workflow | Intelligence Layer | Verified $ impact | $ saved / earned | L2 |

---

## Mid Term (3–6 Months) — Validate in Production

| Workflow | Use Case | Phase | Process Outcome | IntelligentOS Layer | Economic Impact | KPIs | Maturity Lift |
|---------|----------|-------|-----------------|----------------------|-----------------|------|---------------|
| Product Backlog → Delivery Planning | Client Product Teams | Pilot | Predictable delivery decisions | Workflow + Orchestration | ↓ Rework, ↑ throughput | Cycle time, On-time delivery | L3 |
| Revenue Forecasting | Client GTM | Pilot | Improved forecast accuracy | Intelligence + Agent | ↑ Revenue predictability | Forecast variance | L3 |
| Customer Health Scoring | Client CS | Pilot | Proactive retention actions | Agent + Intelligence | ↓ Churn | Retention, NRR | L3 |

## Long Term (6–12 Months) — Scale & Systematize

| Workflow | Use Case | Phase | Process Outcome | IntelligentOS Layer | Economic Impact | KPIs | Maturity Lift |
|---------|----------|-------|-----------------|----------------------|-----------------|------|---------------|
| Cross-Functional Planning | Client Exec Team | Program | Aligned operating cadence | CEO Synthesis Layer | Faster decisions | Decision latency | L4 |
| Resource Allocation Optimization | Client Finance / Ops | Program | Capital deployed to highest ROI | Intelligence + Agent | ↑ ROI | ROI delta, Margin | L4 |
| Continuous Improvement Loop | IA + Clients | Program | Self-optimizing workflows | All Layers | Sustained gains | $ per workflow | L5 |

## IntelligentOS Architecture Reference

- **Workflow Layer:** End-to-end processes with owners and metrics
- **Agent Layer:** Functional AI agents executing and advising
- **Orchestration Layer:** Human–agent coordination and governance
- **Intelligence Layer:** KPIs, insights, and learning loops
- **CEO Synthesis Layer:** Cross-functional visibility and decisions

## Workflow Graduation Rubric

### POV → POC
- Clear workflow definition
- Named owner
- Baseline established
- Economic hypothesis defined

### POC → Pilot
- Working prototype validated
- Real user adoption
- Measurable impact demonstrated
- Governance risks understood

### Pilot → Program
- ROI validated in production
- Adoption stable
- Process documented (SOPs)
- Client ownership established

Workflows that do not meet graduation criteria are paused, redesigned, or retired.

---

## Integration with Success Model KPIs

### Financial
- Revenue Growth Rate
- Gross Margin
- ROI per workflow

### Operational
- Automation hours saved
- On-time delivery
- Cycle time reduction

### Customer
- Retention rate
- Net Revenue Retention
- NPS (workflow cohorts)

### Brand & Culture (Internal)
- Adoption rate
- Internal productivity lift

Each workflow supports at least one Success Model KPI.

---

## Governance

- Each workflow has a Product Owner
- Each workflow reports impact monthly
- Scores are recalculated quarterly
- Roadmap reviewed in Product + CEO cadence

---

## Guiding Principle

Workflows graduate only when they produce verified economic impact and can be operated independently.
