# Intelligent OS — Workflow-Centric Product Roadmap (Living Document)

## Purpose
This roadmap is the source of truth for Intelligent OS product development.
It is workflow-centric, outcome-driven, and explicitly tied to economic impact.

The roadmap is reviewed and updated continuously as workflows move through POV, POC, Pilot, and Program phases.

---

## How to Use This Roadmap

- **Primary unit of value:** Workflows (not features)
- **Primary success measure:** Verified economic impact
- **Primary progression:** Confidence and maturity, not output volume
- **Primary question:** Which workflows are automated, and what value do they deliver?

Every row in this roadmap must be measurable, owned, and economically justified.

---

## North Star Alignment

**North Star Metric**
- Number of workflows automated with verified dollars saved or earned

Each roadmap item must explicitly support this metric.

## Roadmap Scoring Model

The scoring model is used to prioritize workflows objectively and ensure alignment with IA’s product philosophy.

Each workflow is scored across five dimensions.

### Scoring Dimensions (1–5 scale)

1. **Economic Impact Potential**
   - 1 = Minimal or unclear financial impact
   - 5 = Significant, quantifiable dollars saved or earned

2. **Workflow Repeatability**
   - 1 = One-off or highly bespoke
   - 5 = Highly repeatable across clients or functions

3. **Automation Readiness**
   - 1 = Poor data quality, unclear ownership
   - 5 = Clear inputs, owners, and decision logic

4. **Cross-Functional Leverage**
   - 1 = Single-function impact
   - 5 = Multi-function or system-wide impact

5. **Maturity Advancement**
   - 1 = Incremental improvement
   - 5 = Unlocks a meaningful maturity level increase

---

### Scoring Table

| Workflow | Economic Impact | Repeatability | Readiness | Cross-Functional | Maturity Lift | Total Score |
|---------|-----------------|---------------|-----------|------------------|---------------|-------------|
|         |                 |               |           |                  |               |             |

**Total Score = Sum of all five dimensions (Max = 25)**

---

## How Scores Are Used

- **20–25:** Top priority — advance immediately
- **15–19:** High priority — schedule in roadmap
- **10–14:** Explore further — clarify value or readiness
- **<10:** Deprioritize

Scores are reviewed at each roadmap review cycle.

---

## Governance

- Every workflow has a named owner
- Every workflow has defined KPIs
- Every workflow must report economic impact post-implementation
- Workflows that do not demonstrate impact are removed or redesigned

---

## Guiding Principle

> If a workflow cannot demonstrate measurable economic impact, it does not belong on the roadmap.
