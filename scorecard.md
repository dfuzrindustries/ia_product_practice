# Product Practice Scorecard

Our complete measurement framework organized into three tiers: North Star metrics that define ultimate success, Delivery metrics that track operational performance, and Maturity metrics that assess long-term sustainability.

---

## North Star Metrics

These metrics define success for the Product Practice. Every decision, investment, and workflow is ultimately measured against these outcomes.

| Metric | Definition | Current | Target (FY25) | Status |
|--------|------------|---------|---------------|--------|
| **Workflows Automated** | Number of workflows in Program or Partnership phase with verified economic impact | [0] | [TBD] | [TBD] |
| **Dollars Saved** | Annual cost savings verified and sustained through automated workflows | $[0] | $[TBD] | [TBD] |
| **Dollars Earned** | Annual revenue generated or retained through automated workflows | $[0] | $[TBD] | [TBD] |

**Total Economic Impact:** $[0]

---

## Delivery Metrics

These metrics track how effectively we deliver workflows and create value for clients.

### Time to Value

**Definition:** Average time from POV to verified economic impact

| Measurement | Current | Target | Status |
|-------------|---------|--------|--------|
| POV to POC Start | [TBD] days | 7 days | [TBD] |
| POC Duration | [TBD] days | 30 days | [TBD] |
| Pilot Duration | [TBD] days | 90 days | [TBD] |
| **Total: POV to Verified Impact** | **[TBD] days** | **150 days** | **[TBD]** |

---

### Adoption Rate

**Definition:** Percentage of target users actively using workflows in production

| Workflow Phase | Adoption Rate | Target | Status |
|----------------|---------------|--------|--------|
| Pilot | [TBD%] | 70% | [TBD] |
| Program | [TBD%] | 80% | [TBD] |
| Partnership | [TBD%] | 85% | [TBD] |
| **Average** | **[TBD%]** | **80%** | **[TBD]** |

---

### Reliability

**Definition:** Percentage uptime and error-free operation for production workflows

| Metric | Current | Target | Status |
|--------|---------|--------|--------|
| System Uptime | [TBD%] | 99% | [TBD] |
| Error Rate | [TBD%] | <1% | [TBD] |
| User-Reported Issues (per workflow/month) | [TBD] | <5 | [TBD] |

---

## Maturity Metrics

These metrics assess the sustainability and scalability of our workflows and client relationships.

### Client Self-Sufficiency

**Definition:** Percentage of Program workflows where clients operate independently

| Metric | Current | Target | Status |
|--------|---------|--------|--------|
| Workflows Client-Operated | [TBD%] | 90% | [TBD] |
| Client Teams Trained | [TBD] | [TBD] | [TBD] |
| IA Support Hours (per workflow/month) | [TBD] | <5 | [TBD] |
| Client-Led Improvements | [TBD] | [TBD] | [TBD] |

---

### Workflow Scalability

**Definition:** Ability to expand workflows to additional users, use cases, or processes

| Metric | Current | Target | Status |
|--------|---------|--------|--------|
| Average Users per Workflow | [TBD] | 50+ | [TBD] |
| Workflows Scaled Beyond Pilot | [TBD%] | 70% | [TBD] |
| Additional Use Cases Identified | [TBD] | [TBD] | [TBD] |

---

### Governance Effectiveness

**Definition:** Workflows operating with proper controls and zero compliance incidents

| Metric | Current | Target | Status |
|--------|---------|--------|--------|
| Workflows with Documented Governance | [TBD%] | 100% | [TBD] |
| Compliance Incidents | [TBD] | 0 | [TBD] |
| Audit Trail Completeness | [TBD%] | 100% | [TBD] |
| Governance Review Compliance | [TBD%] | 100% | [TBD] |

---

## Supporting Indicators

### Pipeline Health

| Metric | Current | Target |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Active POVs | [0] | [TBD] |
| POV → POC Conversion | [TBD%] | 60% |
| POC → Pilot Conversion | [TBD%] | 70% |
| Pilot → Program Conversion | [TBD%] | 80% |

---

### Client Satisfaction

| Metric | Current | Target |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Net Promoter Score (NPS) | [TBD] | 50+ |
| Client Retention Rate | [TBD%] | 90% |
| Referrals Generated | [TBD] | [TBD] |

## How to Use the Scorecard

**Monthly Review:**  
Product Practice team reviews all metrics, identifies trends, and flags areas needing attention.

**Quarterly Business Review:**  
Executive Leadership reviews North Star metrics and key delivery/maturity indicators to assess strategic progress.

**Phase Gate Reviews:**  
Relevant metrics are reviewed at each phase gate to inform Go/No-Go decisions.

**Continuous Improvement:**  
Metrics below target trigger root cause analysis and corrective action plans.
