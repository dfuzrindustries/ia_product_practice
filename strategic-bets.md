# Strategic Bets & Hypotheses

Where we're placing bets for future growth. These are emerging opportunities, market hypotheses, and innovation areas that could shape the Product Practice's evolution.

---

## What Is a Strategic Bet?

A strategic bet is an investment in an unproven but promising area that could:
- Open new markets or verticals
- Enable breakthrough capabilities
- Create differentiated value
- Build competitive moats
- Scale economic impact significantly

Strategic bets are intentionally exploratory. They're funded separately from core roadmap work and have clear learning objectives and kill criteria.

## Decision Framework for Strategic Bets

### When to Pursue a Bet

**Strong Signals:**
- ✓ Aligns with long-term vision
- ✓ Leverages unique IA capabilities
- ✓ Large addressable opportunity if validated
- ✓ Clear path to testing hypothesis
- ✓ Acceptable risk/reward ratio

**Weak Signals:**
- Requires capabilities we don't have
- Small market or limited scale potential
- No clear way to test hypothesis
- High risk with unclear upside

---

### When to Kill a Bet

**Clear Kill Signals:**
- Learning objectives not met after reasonable timeframe
- Market hypothesis disproven
- Better opportunities emerged
- Resource requirements unsustainable
- Strategic misalignment

**Process:**
1. Document learnings
2. Share insights with team
3. Archive work and artifacts
4. Reallocate resources
5. Move on quickly

## Submitting Strategic Bet Ideas

**Who Can Submit:**  
Anyone in the Product Practice or Product Working Group

**Submission Process:**
1. Use Strategic Bet Proposal Template
2. Submit to Product Practice Lead
3. Initial review within 2 weeks
4. If promising, present to Executive Leadership
5. Decision within 30 days

**Proposal Template:**
- **Hypothesis:** [One sentence]
- **Why This Matters:** [Strategic value]
- **Market Evidence:** [Supporting data]
- **Required Investment:** [Time, money, resources]
- **Success Metrics:** [How we measure]
- **Timeline:** [How long to test]
- **Kill Criteria:** [When to stop]

---

## Learning Culture

Strategic bets are about learning, not just winning:

**We Value:**
- Rapid learning over being right
- Evidence over opinions
- Failed experiments that teach over missed opportunities
- Honest assessment of results
- Sharing learnings broadly

**We Avoid:**
- Sunk cost fallacy (continuing because we've invested)
- Confirmation bias (only seeing evidence we want)
- Analysis paralysis (studying instead of testing)
- Pet projects without clear criteria
