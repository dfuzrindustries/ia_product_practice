# Workflow Graduation Rubric

This rubric defines objective criteria for advancing workflows through the delivery lifecycle.
Graduation is evidence-based and tied to verified economic impact.

**Phases:** POV → POC → Pilot → Program

---

## POV → POC (Ready to Build)

A workflow advances to POC when:
- Workflow is clearly defined (trigger, inputs, decisions, outputs)
- Named owner is assigned
- Baseline is established (current time/cost/error/revenue)
- Economic impact hypothesis is stated (dollars saved/earned)
- KPIs and measurement method are defined

---

## POC → Pilot (Ready for Production Validation)

A workflow advances to Pilot when:
- Prototype is validated with real users
- Measurable impact is demonstrated against agreed KPIs
- Data inputs and system dependencies are confirmed
- Governance and risk considerations are documented
- Adoption signals show repeatable usage intent

---

## Pilot → Program (Ready to Scale)

A workflow advances to Program when:
- ROI is validated in production against success criteria
- Adoption is stable and sustained
- SOPs and playbooks are documented
- Client ownership model is established (RACI, escalation, training)
- Scale constraints and platform implications are understood

---

## Pause / Retire Criteria

A workflow is paused or retired when:
- Economic impact cannot be verified
- Adoption is consistently low
- Data/system constraints prevent reliable operation
- Risk profile is unacceptable relative to value
- A higher-impact workflow displaces it

---

## Guiding Principle

> Workflows graduate only when they produce verified economic impact and can be operated confidently.
