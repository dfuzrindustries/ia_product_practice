## Using the Tracker

**For Executive Leadership:**  
Monitor portfolio health, conversion rates, and at-risk workflows. Use this to identify patterns and allocate support where needed.

**For Product Working Group:**  
Track your workflows through phases, identify blockers early, and coordinate across teams to maintain momentum.

**For Product Practice Team:**  
Manage day-to-day progress, update milestones, and ensure all workflows have clear success measures and decision criteria.

---

## Updating the Tracker

Workflow owners update this tracker:
- **Weekly:** Phase progress and milestone status
- **At phase gates:** Decision outcomes and next phase kickoff
- **As needed:** Risk status changes or major milestones

Contact the Product Practice team for tracker access and training.
