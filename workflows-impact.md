**For Product Working Group:**  
This is your portfolio view. See what's in flight, track progress, and identify patterns that inform future workflow design and delivery.

## Our Commitment

Every workflow in this section is measured against our North Star:
- **Workflows automated** with verified economic impact
- **Dollars saved** through efficiency and optimization
- **Dollars earned** through revenue generation and growth

If it's not delivering measurable economic impact, it doesn't belong here.
